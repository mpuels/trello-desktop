# Trello Desktop

This repo is just a copy of https://github.com/madole/trello-desktop. The original repo
also contains binaries and hence has 187MB when unpacked. I created this repo and only
added the actual source files.

**Clone and run to get the trello app on your desktop.**

**Disclosure**

_This is a simple electron wrapper around Trello.com_

I was finding that I kept closing my browser or the trello tab during development.
I needed trello to run on my desktop like an app and it didn't exist.
I remembered electron can do this so I've set it up to point at trello.com/login and off I go.
